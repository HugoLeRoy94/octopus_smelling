### 1. Methodological Framework

Our research investigates the generation of functional diversity in octopus olfactory channels, which are understood to be pentamers ($m=5$) formed from a pool of 26 different proteins (e.g., 'CR518', 'CR918', etc.). We hypothesize that an olfactory cell's response to a ligand is not from a single, defined channel type but rather from a combinatorial ensemble of all possible pentameric stoichiometries and combinatories (e.g., AAAAA, ABBBB, AABBB, ABABB etc..) based on the genes it expresses. Our central goal is to demonstrate that this heteropentameric formation creates a **diversity of response**, which we define as a dose-response profile that cannot be replicated by a *simple linear combination* of the constituent homopentamer responses.

We will fit the experimental dose-response curves for the homopentamers 'CR518' and 'CR918', as well as the heteropentameric 'CR518\_918' combination, across a panel of 11 ligands (including "Medroxyprogesterone", "Androsterone", "Progesterone", etc.).
-> Experimental dose-response curves measure the current generated by the diffusion of small ions through a membrane.
-> This current is proportional to the opening probability of the channels embedded in the membrane.
-> To rule-out the influence of this proportionality factor, we focus our fitting procedure on the renormalize current:
$$
\text{renormalized current} = \frac{I(c) - I_\text{min}}{I_\text{max}-I_\text{min}} = \frac{p_\text{open}(c) - p_\text{min}}{p_\text{max}-p_\text{min}}
$$
The opening probability can be obtained using the **Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model** as analyzed by Einav and Phillips[^1]. For a pentameric channel ($m=5$), the probability of the channel being open ($p_{open}$) at a given ligand concentration ($c$) is expressed as:

$$
p_{open}(c) = \frac{(1+\frac{c}{K_{O}})^{5}}{(1+\frac{c}{K_{O}})^{5} + e^{-\beta \epsilon}(1+\frac{c}{K_{C}})^{5}}
$$

This model relies on three key thermodynamic parameters[^1]:

* **$\epsilon$ (epsilon):** The **gating free energy**, representing the free energy difference between the closed and open channel states without any ligand bound.
* **$K_O$:** The ligand dissociation constant for the **open** channel state.
* **$K_C$:** The ligand dissociation constant for the **closed** channel state.

A known challenge in this approach, highlighted as "sloppiness" in the supporting information [^1], is that fitting $\epsilon$ and $K_O$ independently is ill-defined, as different combinations can produce nearly identical curves.The system's response is actually governed by a *combination* of these parameters.

Therefore, to ensure a robust and well-constrained fit, we will adopt the paper's dimensionality-reduction strategy. In the biophysically relevant limit where the channel is mostly closed without ligand (i.e., $1 \ll e^{-\beta\epsilon}$), the $p_{open}(c)$ formula can be effectively approximated. This allows us to fit for the two fundamental parameter combinations that truly define the curve:

1.  **$K_C$**: The closed-state dissociation constant.
2.  **$\tilde{K}_{O}$**: An **effective open-state dissociation constant**. This parameter merges the gating energy and the open-state affinity into a single, fittable term:
$$
\tilde{K}_{O} = K_{O}e^{-\beta\epsilon/5},
$$

derived from the general $[EC_{50}] \approx K_{O}e^{-\beta\epsilon/m}$ relationship [^1]. Additionally,

### Information of an Odor Signal

-> Here, we uses concepts from information theory to explore the coding capacity of chemoreceptors and to determine if assembling receptors from different subunits (heteromers) genuinely creates new diversity.

-> The core idea is to measure the **Mutual Information (MI)** between the ligands ($\ell$ from a pool of $L$ possible ligands) and the receptor activation patterns ($b(c_\ell) = \{a_0(c_\ell),\cdots,a_K(\ell)\}$) at concentration $c_\ell$. Considering that the activation curve of the receptors provide a binary signal: activated or not-activated, the activation pattern $b$ becomes a binary word with $K$ digits, where $K$ is the number of receptors. In the following, we assume that $2^K>L$, which means that there are enough receptors to encode each ligand uniquely.

* **Mutual Information** is defined as $MI(L; b) = H(b) - H(b|L)$.
    * $H(b)$ is the **entropy** of the activation patterns
    * $H(b|L)$ is the **conditional entropy**


First consdering **Deterministic Binding:** In an ideal, deterministic scenario, each ligand ($\ell$) always activates one specific pattern ($b^*(c_\ell)$). In this case, knowing the ligand means there is zero uncertainty about the pattern, so $H(b|L) = 0$.
When $H(b|L) = 0$, the mutual information $MI(L; b) = H(b)$. The maximum possible value for $H(b)$ (if all $2^K$ patterns are possible) is $K$. Therefore, the maximum information "capacity" of the system is $K$ bits.
We now explore the effect of the coupling between receptors on the mutual information, and more precisely on the capacity of the channel.

**Model of Redundancy:** Imagine the $k$-th receptor's activation in response to a concentration $c_\ell$ of ligand $\ell$ ($a_k(c_\ell)$) is determined by the others: $a_k(c_\ell) = f(a_1(c_\ell), ..., a_{k-1}(c_\ell))$. As a consequence Because the $k$-th bit is fixed, the total number of *possible* activation patterns $b$ is no longer $2^K$. It is reduced to $2^{K-1}$n and the entropy of the observed patterns $H(b)$ is now reduced to $\log_2(2^{K-1}) = K-1$.
  
**Functional Redundancy:** Considering a heteropentamer made of two type of sub-unit: $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Knowing the activity of two homopentamer at a given concentration, is not sufficient to infer the activity of the heteropentamer. Instead, the whole function of the homopentamers are required to find the activity of the hetero one:
$$
a_{\alpha,\beta}(c_\ell) = F\left[a_\alpha(c_\ell),a_\beta(c_\ell) \right] \hspace{1cm} \forall \ell
$$

### 3. Application to Heteromers (Page 17)

This reasoning is applied to test whether heteromers (receptors built from different subunits) provide *true* new information or are just redundant.

* [cite_start]**Null Hypothesis:** A heteromer brings **no additional information** if its response parameters ($\vec{\phi}^{Hetero}$) can be perfectly predicted by a fixed function $f$ of the parameters of its constituent homomers ($\vec{\phi}^{Homo1}$, $\vec{\phi}^{Homo2}$)[cite: 391, 396, 404].
* [cite_start]**Critical Condition:** This redundancy only holds if that function $f$ is **the SAME for all ligands**[cite: 395].
* [cite_start]**Conclusion:** If the heteromer's response is just a fixed combination of the homomer responses (for all ligands), it is redundant, just like the $k$-th receptor in the previous example[cite: 396]. It doesn't add to the system's information capacity. [cite_start]True diversity ($a_k \neq f(a_1...)$) requires that the heteromer responds to ligands in a way that *cannot* be predicted by its parts[cite: 385].
